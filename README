This is a proof of concept plugin designed to allow devlopers to link installed plugins and themes to external directories.  Each time Mura reloads it copies the latest code from the external directories.</p>
The mappings are configured in the sync.xml at the root of the plugin.

This plugin requires a Mura core version of 5.4.4589 or higher.
